## Without state constraint

### Energy minimisation problem with free final state and time

#### Presentation of the problem

The energy-min simple integrator with free fina state and time problem consists in minimising

```math
    \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{tf} u^2(t) \, \mathrm{d}t
```

subject to the constraints

```math
    \dot x(t) = u(t), u(t) \in \mathbb{R}
```

and the limit conditions

```math
    x(0) = -1, \quad x(tf) - tf - 10 = 0.
```

#### The problem from CTProblems.jl

You can access the problem in the CTProblems package:

```@example main
using CTProblems
prob = Problem(:integrator, :dim1, :energy, :free)
```

Then, the model is given by

```@example main
prob.model
```

You can plot the solution.

```@example main
plot(prob.solution, size=(700, 400))
```
